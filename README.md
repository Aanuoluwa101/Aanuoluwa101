# ðŸ‘‹ Meet me
I'm a backend developer on a mission to build softwares that people love. Backend reminds me of the word "Backbone", and just like a solid backbone ensures stability, I strive to create reliable, scalable, and performant solutions with every line of code. I've had the opportunity of writing code that solve real-life problems, and I'm excited to keep creating solutions that truly make a difference.
